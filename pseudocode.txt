Brickbreaker pseudocode by mr.g:

declare all needed constants and variables
assign initial values
repeat while there are bricks and game is not over
  draw bricks that are not "broken"
  draw the ball and the paddle
  update the game window (animation)
  check for key input and move the paddle if required
  check whether the ball has collided with a brick
    if so, "break" that brick and bounce the ball
  check whether the ball has hit left/right/top border of the screen
    if so, bounce the ball
  check whether the ball has collided with the paddle
    if so, bounce the ball
  check whether the ball has left the screen from the bottom
    if so, the game is over
  move the ball
